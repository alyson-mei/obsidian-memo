## obsidian-memo project
Hi there! 👋 \
At first, this project was just a simple automatic backup of my Obsidian files using Bash and cron — but then I decided to experiment with different types of dynamic content and API integration. \
The following sections of this README are updated on a schedule and include AI-generated content. The same goes for commit messages, which are also generated automatically.

## digital fragments: Liz's journal
hi, i'm Liz! i write code for a living and live in a city where neon spills through windows at all hours and the gentle thrum of servers feels more like home than silence

this is my journal—thoughts captured during deep focus hours when the world gets quiet and the real work begins. debugging sessions, random observations, the way my cat kiku judges my life choices, moments when the city shows its softer edges
started keeping this because days blur together too easily and i want to remember them better, make each one feel more distinct. the technical victories, the philosophical rabbit holes, the way code sometimes teaches you things about breathing... or hidden patterns in everyday chaos

mostly i write for myself, but maybe someone else will find something familiar here—the rhythm of problem-solving, the comfort of mechanical keyboards, the strange intimacy of a city that's learned to pulse with your heartbeat
welcome to the archive of small revelations 🌙

### 26 aug 2025 
**city's silent pulse 📡**

3:30 am. the city's public wifi, a familiar thrum against the late-night quiet, felt different tonight. a quiet, almost organic rhythm.

my monitors, usually a blur of code, bloomed with abstract visualizations. not just data streams, but slow-moving clusters, like digital schools of fish, migrating across the grid. peaking around phantom dinner bells, then drifting to entertainment zones, finally settling into the deep night's residential quiet. anonymous, yes, but so utterly human in their patterns. a shared, unconscious dance across the network. sipping from my pale blue thinking mug, the warmth a counterpoint to the cool glow, i felt a strange sense of belonging. kiku, curled in her repurposed takeout container, twitched an ear, a soft, ginger anchor in the digital tide.

the city's network, not just infrastructure. it's a breathing, unseen tapestry of shared lives. a comforting constant in my solitary night 🌃

### Trullo buildings in Alberobello, Apulia, Italy
![Bing](https://img.peapix.com/056cae9cadba4fdd8574da384db036fe_1920.jpg)

If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy. But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.

Alberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style. In 1996, UNESCO gave the trulli of Alberobello the heritage stamp of approval. It's not every day that a loophole becomes a landmark.

## natural wonder of the day
### Bungle Bungle Range, Purnululu National Park, Australia
![Wonder](https://www.10wallpaper.com/wallpaper/1920x1200/2205/Bungle_Bungle_Range_Purnululu_National_Park_Australia_Bing_5K_1920x1200.jpg)

Imagine a landscape where time and wind have sculpted the earth into colossal, striped beehives, rising dramatically from the remote Australian wilderness. This is the Bungle Bungle Range, a breathtaking natural masterpiece hidden deep within Purnululu National Park in Western Australia's rugged Kimberley region. A proud UNESCO World Heritage site, these striking sandstone domes, some towering hundreds of feet, have been meticulously shaped by nature's forces over 350 million years, forming a geological phenomenon unlike any other.

The Bungle Bungles' most captivating feature is their distinctive beehive shape, characterized by vivid orange and black banding. These vibrant striations are a testament to the varying layers of sandstone and the growth of cyanobacteria (lichens) on the rock surfaces, creating a truly unique visual spectacle. Visitors wandering among these ancient rock formations are met with an overwhelming sense of scale, feeling dwarfed by the sheer magnitude of these natural skyscrapers. The warm sunlight illuminates the vibrant colors, making the 'beehives' glow and shift hues throughout the day, while the vastness of the landscape instills a profound sense of wonder and serenity. Exploring the Bungle Bungle Range is an adventure that needs to be seen to be believed, offering an unparalleled encounter with Earth's raw artistic power. Luxury tours often provide brilliant access, allowing travelers to immerse themselves in this remote and magnificent wonder.
